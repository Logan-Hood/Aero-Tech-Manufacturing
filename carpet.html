                    <p>Running a business the size of Carpet Tech is no small feat. We can't afford 
                        to lose time anywhere and using the Aero Tech XT provides us with the 
                        ability to offer the best quality service to our customers in the shortest 
                        amount of time possible. I've used many cleaning rigs in my years in the 
                        carpet cleaning industry and thus far the power and performance of the XT 
                        is unsurpassed. The XT distinguishes us from our competitors and provides us 
                        with an advantage not only in cleaning capability but in marketing and sales 
                        as well.

                <div class="review">
                    <p>I recently purchased a brand new AEROTECH in December 2017, and it has been the best business 
                        decision I have ever made. I have been in the industry 20 years and I have never seen a machine 
                        perform like the AEROTECH, when you show up in someone’s driveway all the customers can say is 
                        WOW! This guy must really care.  I can honestly say in all the years of carpet cleaning I have 
                        never had so many compliments and referrals.  My business has grown at least  25/30% since I 
                        had the truck in a few short months.  I can’t even keep up with the phone calls half of the 
                        time. If you are considering buying and AEROTECH, think no more it will be the best decision 
                        for your business and it will out clean any other truck PERIOD. The dry times are unbelievable 
                        and the heat is unreal. I have had 3 carpet cleaning Vans with the biggest machines made and 
                        nothing even compares and there is no way I would ever go back to one again. I will be 
                        purchasing a second AEROTECH unit to add to my fleet. I am a VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER, and I 
                        would like to thank Jeremy and all the guys out at AEROTECH for your help and support through 
                        my purchase. If you have any questions the phone numbers on the truck call me.
                    </p>

                   <p>We have been using the truck for 6 months now and can't imagine having to go 
                    back to a Van type unit!  Our productivity has increased by at least 30% using 
                    this unit due to the shear Heat and Vacuum. When this unit says 230° degrees, 
                    it’s every bit of that and more! Even with 2 wands it out cleans my Blueline 
                    machine and holds more heat! Aero Tech's customer service has been second to 
                    none. That’s a great feeling to have with this sort of investment. Thanks for a 
                    great product and I’m looking forward to getting my second unit soon!

                    <p><strong>"FOR THE SERIOUS CLEANER IT'S A NO BRAINER INVESTMENT"</strong></p>
                    <p>This is my 2nd Aero Tech system and my 3rd big truck I've owned and it is 
                        amazing. The overall improvements to the XT system are awesome from my 2006 
                        to this 2014 and the new Isuzu truck is like going to a Cadillac from a 
                        Ford. The truck is just beautiful.
                        We are a small company with 2 trucks and we work the heck out of this truck 
                        doing dual wand cleaning daily and even triple wand cleaning occasionally.
                        The folks at Aero Tech are great to work with and very accommodating and 
                        will do what it takes to deliver on what you want. We live in the east and 
                        had the truck under coated and the blower exhaust wrapped in stainless to 
                        protect our investment. Our last truck we sold and after 7 years and over 
                        5100 hours of run time, we still sold it for 55% of the original investment.

                    <p>We have been using the truck for 6 months now and can't imagine having to go 
                        back to a Van type unit!  Our productivity has increased by at least 30% 
                        using this unit due to the shear Heat and Vacuum. When this unit says 230° 
                        degrees, it’s every bit of that and more! Even with 2 wands it out cleans my 
                        Blueline machine and holds more heat! Aero Tech's customer service has been 
                        second to none. That’s a great feeling to have with this sort of investment. 
                        Thanks for a great product and I’m looking forward to getting my second unit 
                        soon!
